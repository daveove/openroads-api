# OpenRoads API
[![Build Status](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/opengovt/openroads-api.svg?token=tqZJSdEbKcpsuN9Fxqua&branch=master)](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/opengovt/openroads-api)

The OpenRoads API is part of the [OpenRoads project](https://github.com/developmentseed/openroads).

## Local development using Docker
This repo comes with Docker configuration to spin up the API and a database. This same setup is also used by Travis to run tests against.

To set up your environment, make sure `docker` and `docker-compose` are installed on your machine. For Mac OS X and Windows download the [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/docker-toolbox). For Linux follow [these](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) instructions.

For Mac OS X or Windows, make sure you're running the following commands in a terminal that has the docker environment variables set. This can be done by running the `Docker Quickstart Terminal` app, or running `eval $(docker-machine env default)`. Linux users may need to use `sudo`


### Useful commands
This will launch the API and database in the background at `http://YOUR_DOCKER_HOST:4000`.

```sh
npm run docker-start # starts the API and DB
npm run docker-stop # stops the API and DB
npm run docker-logs # gets the API logs
```

When you make local changes while the docker container is running, you have to stop and start it again to rebuild your changes. If this is too cumbersome, you may consider running only the database with Docker (`npm run docker-start-db`) and run the API independently (`OR_ENV=local npm start`).

### Running the database
You can also just spin up the database and make it available on `$DOCKER_HOST:5433`:

```sh
npm run docker-start-db # start the db in the on its own at 
npm run docker-kill # kills the db
```

The database will already be populated with test data.

### Running tests
The following command creates an empty postgres db, populates it with test data, and runs the tests against it. 

```sh
npm run docker-test
```


To run a db on its own you can run docker-compose up [-d] postgres which will start the database on its own at $DOCKER_HOST:5433

## Running the API without Docker
It is also possible to run the API without Docker. This is for example useful if you want to connect directly to the [database running in Docker](https://github.com/opengovt/openroads-api/tree/feature/docker-tests#running-the-database).

Before running the server, you will need to add `local.js` in your root directory to include directions to the postgresql database. Add your own values to the url where you're hosting your OSM database. The `docker-start.sh` in the `db-server` repo is a starting point for creating your own OSM DB.

```javascript
module.exports.connection = {
    production: 'postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:POST/DATABASE',
}
```

To make it easier to point at different databases (e.g., a staging or test db), you may additional urls in addition to `production`, and then target them using the `OR_ENV` environment variable.  E.g.:

```js
module.exports.connection = {
    production: 'postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:POST/DATABASE',
    staging: 'postgres://user2:otherpass@staging.host.com:port/db',
    local: 'postgres://osm:password@DOCKER_HOST:5433/api06_test',
}
```

And then run `OR_ENV=local npm start`

### Troubleshooting
If you have trouble connecting to a hosted database from your local machine, the service may require you to connect over SSL. Add `?ssl=true` after the database name, for example: `postgres://user2:otherpass@staging.host.com:port/db?ssl=true`.


## Building the documentation locally

```sh
npm run gendoc
```

When deploying, Heroku builds the documentation. The .js and .json files that are built by `npm run gendoc`, should not be committed to Github.
